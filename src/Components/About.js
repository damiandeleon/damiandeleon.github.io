                    <p>
                      I have a lifelong passion for figuring out how things work, and fixing things.  Be it from learning about physiology and fitness, to tearing down and building my first comptuer, and fixing cars with my father. My 23 years in business was built on taking what clients wanted for their businesses and making it happen. I used various skills such as project managmeent, process mangement, technical writing, operations management, and quality management to be successful.  When I discovered coding, I found that those skills tranfsered perfectly into the DevOps and the Agile development concepts. I found a passion in coding and it's ability to impact society and businesses.  I never stop coding and I'm excited to tackle what's next.

                      I started my career in business after graduating college.
                      For the years between 1997 to 2020, I worked in the
                      contact center industry. My professional career in Austin
                      was devoted to Concentrix Corp. I had much success with
                      the company between 2003 - 2020. However I decided that I
                      wanted to try something completely different in a new
                      emerging industry. Web Development and coding was
                      something that I knew would give me the exciting challenge
                      I was seeking. I am excited to make it my new career.
