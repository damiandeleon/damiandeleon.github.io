              <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
              <p>
                I have a lifelong passion for figuring out how things work, and
                fixing things; be it from learning about physiology and fitness,
                to tearing down and building my first comptuer. My career has
                been built on taking what clients wanted for their businesses
                and making it happen. I used various skills such as project
                managmeent, process mangement, technical writing, operations
                management, and quality management to be successful. When I
                discovered coding, I found that those skills tranfsered
                perfectly into the DevOps and the Agile development concepts. I
                found a passion in coding and its ability to impact society and
                businesses. I never stop coding and I'm excited to tackle what's
                next.
